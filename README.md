# Raspberry Pi Handheld (Leviathan)

[Visit the project page!](https://itscinnamon.me/projects/leviathan)

# UPDATE 09/03/2023

This project will likely never be tested or finished now. It is getting increasingly difficult to find a reasonable source of a CM4 to begin and my previously backordered CM4 has since been cancelled without notice.

**Please do not try to make this board, it will probably break something!**
