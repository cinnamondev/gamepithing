game pi thing




Board should have USB type C for USB2 OTG and another for C power. C power should charge battery.


May need to use the PCIE for some function inside but i hope not - if we can use the MIPI GBASP IPS upgrade mod display thats already proven, itll make our life easier - just need to design an adaptor board or try to design a fpc thingy for it? - if we cant do that we will lose much of our GPIO to DPI alt mode and thats not good :(
