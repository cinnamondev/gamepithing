# Board designs

Kicad 6+ is required for these files.
If you want to build this board yourself, I reccomend using the Gerber files built in the Releases section instead. If you want to combine these there are plenty of gerber paneliser softwares available. (Maybe only combine the left shoulder and adaptor as you will likely exceed the JLCPCB sizes).
