# Contributing
If for some reason you are contributing to this, here are some handy guidelines:


- As a licensee, your modified design should add a record of *your* changes to the design of the project. These changes should go into [CHANGES.txt](CHANGES.txt), and that is where you will also find a guide to writing about design changes. This is much like a humans.txt, but is intended as part of the License to track design changes and this should follow the Source at all times.

- Any notices, such as license information and source code location should NOT be modified. They are intended to be visible on the design for future reference. For more information on this, please read about the [license.](LICENSE.md)

- Don't be a dick! This should go without saying...

- Any pull requests should follow the format:
```
# Description

Please make note of any design changes below this paragraph, as well as a *brief* description in the CHANGES.txt file, if you haven't already. This is mandatory!

Any issues this fixes should be listed below with the associated issue number ie: "Fixes #1111,#1112"

## Type of design change
(Please delete any that do not apply.)

- Design change (To PCB/Schematic)
- Firmware/Software change
- Bug fix (there should be an associated issue, use the area above)
- Feature addition (new functionality)
- Breaking change (breaks existing functionality)
- Requires new documentation
- Optimisation (simplification of design, for example)

## Testing

Please show/describe how you tested your changes. Board changes and firmware should be tested prior to being put in a pull request

# A note on derivative works
lets be nice :)

You should make sure you are following the license in **good faith** and to the best of your abilities! If you are producing a derivative work, I reccomend following [this guide](https://ohwr.org/project/cernohl/wikis/uploads/b88fd806c337866bff655f2506f23d37/cern_ohl_s_v2_user_guide.txt) from CERN. 

This is a FOSS project, commerial usage is also completely fine, as long as you keep within the terms of the license. 

Per the license (as of 19.11.2022), all derivative works will be licensed under the **same license** as this project. This means your **source must be open, easily available and keep track of all changes** (pretty please).

If you don't intend on contributing your additions back to the original repo (**whose notices should remain intact**), you are free to add additional notices indicating a source for your derivative work, and indicating a source for future changes in CHANGES.txt (for example, saying "Changes past DD MM YYYY are available from https://example-url/ .")

Also, I'm not a lawyer, tried to summarise what you should be doing as best as possible here, but you should refer to the LICENSE AND GUIDE as much as possible!
